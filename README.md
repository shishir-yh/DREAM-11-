Description: This project is a player selection platform, where players have individual profiles with specific descriptions and a designated draft price. Users can increase the amount in their account to purchase players as needed and also have the flexibility to release them if desired. Each user has a set budget and can manage their team accordingly. However, a user is restricted from selecting more than six players per team

Technologies used:
1. React.js
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It helps in creating dynamic and interactive web pages by allowing  to manage the app's state and re-render components efficiently as data changes. In this  project, React is essential for handling the player selection, budget updates, and ensuring smooth user interaction.

2. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows  to style components quickly without writing custom CSS.

3. Daisy UI
Daisy UI is a component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-styled components (such as buttons, cards, modals) that are customizable and fit well with Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.

Key features of project:

Dynamic Budget Management:
Users can view and manage their budget in real-time, allowing them to add funds as needed and track spending based on player draft prices. This feature ensures users stay within their budget while forming their team and see immediate updates on their remaining balance after each purchase or release.

Player Selection and Release:
Users can add players to their team based on their profiles and draft prices, with the flexibility to release players if needed. This allows users to customize their team strategically while adhering to the six-player limit, enabling a dynamic selection experience.

Team Constraints and Notifications:
The app restricts users to selecting a maximum of six players per team. Notifications alert users when they reach this limit or make adjustments, helping maintain a smooth user experience and clear understanding of the rules.
